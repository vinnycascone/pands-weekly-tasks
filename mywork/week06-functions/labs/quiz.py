# function yo takes one parameter
def yo(a):
  return a * 2

# here we are calling the function yo
# and are passing in an argument, 3
yo(3)


# the program should return a mathematical operation equal to 6 
# a) We haven't given the print function so the program won't print anything
# we need to add print(yo(3))
